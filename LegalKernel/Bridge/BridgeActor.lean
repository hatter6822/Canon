LegalKernel.Bridge.BridgeActor — Workstream B.3
(Ethereum integration plan §6.3).

Reserves `ActorId 0` as the *bridge actor* — the authority under
which all L1-derived Canon actions are signed.  The bridge actor's
public key is set at deployment time and is *not* rotatable except
via a dedicated governance event (out of MVP scope).

Design notes:

  * The bridge actor's `ActorId` is fixed at `0`, the lowest
    `UInt64`.  `AddressBook.empty.nextActorId = 1`, so any address
    assigned via `assign` gets `id ≥ 1` — the bridge actor's slot
    is never overwritten.

  * `bridgePolicy` is the deployment's `AuthorityPolicy` for the
    bridge actor.  It admits exactly the L1-derivable action
    variants:

      * `replaceKey`       — bridge-actor-signed key rotations on
                             behalf of registered identities.
      * `registerIdentity` — first-time identity registrations
                             (Workstream B's L1 → Canon translator
                             flow; see `Bridge.Ingest`).

    Other action variants (`transfer`, `mint`, `burn`,
    `freezeResource`, the positive-incentive trio, the dispute
    pipeline, `rollback`) are explicitly rejected.  Deployments
    that need broader bridge-actor capabilities (e.g. a sovereign
    deployment that wants the bridge to mint synthetic tokens)
    extend the policy via `AuthorityPolicy.union`.

  * The `bridgePolicy` is decidable; the five §12.9 theorems below
    discharge each branch by pure `decide`.

  * Workstream C will extend the policy (when its `deposit` /
    `withdraw` constructors land) to also admit those variants
    for the bridge actor.  The extension goes through
    `AuthorityPolicy.union` and does not modify this module.

This module is **not** part of the kernel TCB.  Bugs here would
weaken the bridge's authority guarantees but cannot violate any
kernel invariant — the kernel's `apply_admissible` rejects any
action that fails the supplied `AuthorityPolicy.authorized`
predicate.

Coverage map:

  * §6.3 (WU B.3) — `bridgeActor`, `bridgePolicy`, the five
    decidable-policy theorems (#32, #34, #35, #36 from §12.9),
    plus a `bridgePolicy_rejects_*` family for the other action
    constructors.  `bridgePolicy_rejects_withdraw` (#33 from
    §12.9) is reserved for Workstream C.4 when the `withdraw`
    constructor lands.
  * §12.9 — five theorems below (`bridgePolicy_rejects_transfer`,
    `bridgePolicy_authorizes_replaceKey`,
    `bridgePolicy_authorizes_registerIdentity`, plus the wider
    rejection family).

/-! ## The bridge actor

`ActorId 0` is reserved for the bridge actor — the deployment
authority that signs every L1-derived Canon action.

The reservation is operational: `AddressBook.empty.nextActorId = 1`,
so addresses assigned via `assign` get `id ≥ 1`, leaving id 0
exclusively for the bridge.  No structural enforcement is needed;
the convention plus the runtime adaptor's discipline suffice. -/

/-- The bridge actor's `ActorId`.  Fixed at `0` so that the
    `AddressBook`'s assigned ids (starting from `1`) never collide
    with the bridge actor's slot. -/
def bridgeActor : ActorId := 0

/-! ## Bridge `AuthorityPolicy`

The `bridgePolicy` admits only the L1-derivable action variants
when the signer is the bridge actor.  All other (signer, action)
pairs are rejected.

The decidability witness pattern-matches on the action constructor;
each branch is a finite conjunction of decidable equalities, so
`decide` discharges every theorem. -/

/-- The set of `Action` constructors that the bridge actor is
    permitted to sign.

    Listed positively (rather than negatively) so future expansion
    (Workstream C: `deposit` / `withdraw`) is a single branch
    addition rather than a re-derivation of the rejection set. -/

/-- The bridge actor's authorisation policy.  Authorises an action
    iff:

    Decidable instance derived from the conjunction. -/
