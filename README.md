# Canon — A Societal Kernel

**Version:** v0.1.0 &nbsp;·&nbsp; **Build tag:** `canon-encoder-injectivity`
&nbsp;·&nbsp; **Toolchain:** Lean 4 v4.29.1 &nbsp;·&nbsp; **License:** GPL-3.0

Canon is a **proof-carrying state-transition system** built in Lean 4.
The kernel does not say *what* is legal; it defines *what it means*
for a state change to be legal, and the build mechanically rejects
everything else. Specific rules — transfers, mints, signed actions,
deposits, withdrawals, disputes, actor-scoped policies — are
first-class values that compose with proof obligations the type
checker will not accept without discharge.

Around that core, Canon ships an authority layer with
replay-impossible signed actions, a canonical binary encoding, a
crash-consistent persistent log with byte-identical replay auditor,
a four-stage dispute pipeline with type-level Stage-3 enforcement,
an Ethereum-anchored bridge with sparse-Merkle-tree withdrawal
proofs, actor-scoped local policies, an interactive fault-proof
game for dispute resolution under a 1-of-anyone-honest trust model,
and a full law-declaration language ("Lex") with deployment
manifests, semantic-diff tooling, and codegen.

The full architectural and mathematical blueprint is
[`docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md`](docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md). Start there for the
formal model, threat model, and phased roadmap.

A green CI run on `lake build`, `lake test`, and the audit binaries
below is the authoritative signal that all phase-acceptance criteria
still hold. The two TCB files require **two reviewers** per PR
(Genesis Plan §13.6); non-TCB modules require one.

## What's novel

Canon's distinguishing commitments — properties the build
mechanically enforces that comparable systems leave to convention or
audit. Each item is grounded in a Lean theorem the build will not
accept with a `sorry`. The full per-theorem catalogue lives in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and a curated subset is in
[Headline theorems](#headline-theorems) below.

| # | Property                                                  | Backing theorem(s)                                                                    |
|---|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Legality is a type, not a convention.**  A `Transition` carries a `Prop`-valued precondition, a constructive `Decidable` witness, and a total state transformer. The executable `step_impl` only advances state when the witness resolves; reading the kernel never depends on classical logic. | `impl_refines_spec`, `impl_noop_if_not_pre` |
| 2 | **Tiny TCB, three-axiom proof discipline.**  The trusted core is two modules. Every kernel theorem reduces to exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. `Verify` and `hashBytes` are `opaque` (deployment-supplied), not `axiom`. | `#print axioms <theorem>` |
| 3 | **Type-level economic firewalls.**  `IsConservative` and `IsMonotonic` are typeclasses. A `ConservativeLawSet` or `MonotonicLawSet` deployment will not elaborate if a non-conservative or supply-destroying law is on its list. `mint_not_conservative`, `burn_not_conservative`, and `burn_not_monotonic` ship as the **negative witnesses** that make the firewall sound. | `ConservativeLawSet`, `MonotonicLawSet`, `total_supply_global` |
| 4 | **Replay protection as a Lean theorem.**  A successfully applied signed action is no longer admissible at the post-state; no two distinct admissible actions by the same signer share a nonce. Both follow from a per-actor strictly-monotone nonce ledger. | `replay_impossible`, `nonce_uniqueness`, `expectsNonce_strict_mono` |
| 5 | **Canonical, injective serialisation with domain separation.**  Every `Action`, `SignedAction`, `State`, and `ExtendedState` has a canonical CBE byte form with mechanically-proved round-trip and injectivity. The decoder rejects non-canonical inputs (unsorted / duplicate map keys). `signInput` prefixes a deployment-ID hash so signatures cannot replay across deployments. | `*_roundtrip`, `*_encode_injective`, `signInput_deterministic` |
| 6 | **Crash-consistent log + byte-identical replay.**  The on-disk log is an append-only frame stream with a per-frame integrity trailer. The standalone `canon-replay` binary reproduces the runtime's `StateHash` byte-for-byte from the same log on a separate machine with no shared state. | `replay_deterministic`, `hashBytes_deterministic` |
| 7 | **Pure dispute pipeline with type-level Stage-3 enforcement.**  Four pure-Lean stages (`fileDispute → checkEvidence → proposeVerdict → applyVerdict`) over a closed inductive of five claim variants. The safe `applyVerdict` requires a `VerdictPassedStage3` propositional witness; every error path is mechanically unreachable. | `applyVerdict_under_witness_succeeds`, `applyWithdraw_idempotent` |
| 8 | **Ethereum bridge with proven-correct withdrawal proofs.**  A height-64 sparse Merkle tree over `BridgeState.pending` produces a 32-byte withdrawal root. The L1 contracts (`solidity/`) port the verifier line-for-line and ship deployment-immutable (no proxies, no admin, no `Pausable`). | `verifyProof_complete`, `verifyProof_sound`, `eip712Wrap_injective` |
| 9 | **Actor-scoped policies (Workstream LP).**  Each actor declares a `LocalPolicy` (deny tags / require recipient ∈ set / cap amount) constraining their *own* outgoing actions, with a structural meta-action exemption that mechanically prevents lockout. | `localPolicy_meta_action_independent` |
| 10 | **Interactive fault-proof game (Workstream H).**  An on-L1 bisection game that converges to a single mis-stepped action under a 1-of-anyone-honest trust model. State commits are byte-equal to canonical sub-states under collision-freedom; an honest challenger always wins against an invalid state root. | `bisection_converges_after_enough_rounds`, `honest_challenger_wins_against_invalid_state_root` |
| 11 | **Lex law-declaration language with deployment manifests.**  A high-level surface (`lexlaw`) elaborates law declarations into Lean `Transition`s; the `deployment` macro emits deterministic manifest hashes. Governance tooling (`lex_diff` classifies `patch` / `minor` / `major` bumps, `lex_format` canonicalises clause order). All 17 kernel-built-in laws ship a Lex re-expression that is byte-equivalent to the hand-written form (verified at elaboration time via `rfl`). | `lex_law` macro + `deployment` macro |
| 12 | **Sparse-Merkle-tree cell proofs (Workstream SC.1 / SC.2 / SC.3).**  A gas-efficient cell-proof scheme for the fault-proof game's bisection step: instead of submitting the full witness sub-state (`O(|sub-state|)` gas), the responder submits an SMT path (`O(log n)` gas).  Under collision-resistance, no two valid proofs can witness different values for the same `(root, key)` pair — the load-bearing binding property the L1 contract relies on.  The Solidity verifier (`SmtCellVerifier`, SC.2) walks the path on-chain in ≈ 35-50k gas; a 100-entry cross-stack corpus (SC.3) ratifies byte-for-byte agreement between the Lean and Solidity sides across 50 honest entries and 50 adversarial entries spanning six tamper classes. | `smtCellProof_sound_under_collision_free`, `smtCellProof_no_value_substitution`, `crosscheck-smt-cell-proof` (corpus) |

## Quickstart

Canon depends only on a pinned Lean 4 toolchain — no Mathlib, no
external Lake packages. The toolchain version is read from
`lean-toolchain`.

```bash
# Recommended: SHA-256-verified setup.  Pins the toolchain integrity
# and (with --build) runs the full compile.
./scripts/setup.sh                       # idempotent
./scripts/setup.sh --build               # full setup + lake build

# Manual alternative (skips integrity verification):
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh \
  | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain none
elan toolchain install "$(cat lean-toolchain)"

# Daily commands.
source ~/.elan/env
lake build                               # full project (default target)
lake build LegalKernel.<Module>          # fast incremental feedback
lake test                                # ~1 835 tests across ~100 suites
```

### Audit / CI gates

Each is a separate `lake exe` binary; CI blocks merges on any
non-zero exit.

| Binary                              | What it enforces                                              |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lake exe count_sorries`            | Zero `sorry` in any kernel-TCB module                         |
| `lake exe tcb_audit`                | TCB import allowlist (`tcb_allowlist.txt`)                    |
| `lake exe stub_audit`               | No placeholder bodies under red-flag docstrings               |
| `lake exe naming_audit`             | Content-name discipline (no `wuN_*`, `phaseN_*`, etc.)        |
| `lake exe deferral_audit`           | No `DEFERRED` / `TODO` / "follow-up" markers                  |
| `lake exe lex_lint`                 | Lex registry append-only discipline + sidecar consistency     |
| `lake exe lex_codegen --check`      | Lex codegen-input bytes match generated Lean                  |
| `lake exe lex_codegen --gen-property-tests --check` | Auto-generated property tests stay in sync   |

### Runtime smoke test

```bash
.lake/build/bin/canon info                       # build tag + phase
.lake/build/bin/canon bootstrap /tmp/test.log    # init an empty log
.lake/build/bin/canon-replay /tmp/test.log       # reproduce state hash
```

### Lex governance tooling (LX-M3)

```bash
.lake/build/bin/lex_diff <ref-a> <ref-b>         # semantic diff + bump class
.lake/build/bin/lex_diff --git HEAD~1 HEAD       # ...using git refs
.lake/build/bin/lex_format <file.lean>           # pretty-print + canonicalise
```

### Workstream-D withdrawal-proof CLI

```bash
.lake/build/bin/canon withdrawal-proof SNAP_PATH WITHDRAWAL_ID
```

### Solidity layer (Workstream E + H)

See [`solidity/README.md`](solidity/README.md) for the day-to-day
developer guide.

```bash
cd solidity && ./scripts/vendor-deps.sh          # one-time: vendor OZ + forge-std
cd solidity && forge build                       # solc 0.8.20, via_ir
cd solidity && forge test                        # ~340 tests across 24 suites
cd solidity && make test-cross-stack             # F.1.x equivalence suite
cd solidity && make testnet-acceptance-dryrun    # F.3 local fork dry-run
```

### Rust host runtime (Workstream RH)

See [`runtime/README.md`](runtime/README.md) for the day-to-day
developer guide.  At the RH-H landing the workspace ships a shared
CLI-helpers crate, a cross-stack fixture loader, and skeleton
crates for the eight downstream work units (RH-A through RH-G).

```bash
# Toolchain pinned in runtime/rust-toolchain.toml (stable 1.83).
cd runtime && cargo build --workspace --all-targets
cd runtime && cargo test --workspace
cd runtime && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd runtime && cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

## How correctness is enforced

Canon's correctness story is *what the build will not accept*.
Every commit must clear the following gates before merge.

| Posture                                                              | Mechanism                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| All Lean test suites pass (`ALL TESTS PASSED`)                       | `lake test` (`Tests.lean` driver)                |
| All forge suites pass                                                | `forge test` in `solidity/`                      |
| Zero `sorry` in any kernel-TCB module                                | `lake exe count_sorries`                         |
| TCB imports stay on the allowlist                                    | `lake exe tcb_audit`                             |
| Stub / placeholder bodies flagged                                    | `lake exe stub_audit`                            |
| No content-name discipline violations                                | `lake exe naming_audit`                          |
| No deferral markers (`TODO`, `DEFERRED`, …)                          | `lake exe deferral_audit`                        |
| Lex registry well-formed + sidecars consistent                       | `lake exe lex_lint`                              |
| Generated codegen is byte-stable                                     | `lake exe lex_codegen --check`                   |
| Every public surface has a `/-- … -/` doc                            | `linter.missingDocs := true` (lakefile)          |
| No silent universe / type-variable creation                          | `autoImplicit := false` (lakefile)               |
| No dead bindings                                                     | `linter.unusedVariables := true` (lakefile)      |
| No build warnings                                                    | CI strict-warnings gate                          |
| Build, tests, and audits run on every PR                             | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`                       |

### Determinism

Canon's runtime guarantees are **byte-identical**, not "semantically
equivalent". `replay_deterministic`, `hashBytes_deterministic`,
`state_encode_deterministic`, and `signInput_deterministic` together
imply that any two replicas given the same `(genesis, log)` produce
the same final state hash, the same encoded state bytes, the same
per-action sign-input bytes, and the same content-hash bytes —
across architectures.

### Decidability discipline

Every `Transition.decPre` should be definable as
`fun _ => inferInstance` whenever the precondition is built from
arithmetic comparisons, `Nat` operations, and finite conjunctions.
A law needing a hand-written `Decidable` derivation is a signal to
security-review the law (§14.8): preconditions that resist
`inferInstance` often hide an unbounded quantifier or a
non-computable predicate that would break the executable path. See
[`docs/decidability_discipline.md`](docs/decidability_discipline.md).

### Hash-function swap-point

The Lean fallback is FNV-1a-64 (deterministic, 32-byte output via
zero-padding for forward compatibility with the production
BLAKE3 / keccak256 swap). The fallback is **fail-fast** at the CLI
boundary: `canon-replay` aborts with `SNAPSHOT_DECODE_ERROR` rather
than silently proceeding when the linked hash is the fallback
(`--allow-fallback-hash` opts in for testing). See
[`docs/abi.md`](docs/abi.md) §11.

## Trust assumptions

Canon's authority and bridge guarantees are conditional on three
deployment-supplied surfaces. None are Lean axioms — `#print axioms`
on every kernel theorem returns a subset of the three Lean built-ins.

1. **`Verify` is EUF-CMA secure** (Phase 3 WU 3.4). The kernel's
   `replay_impossible` and `nonce_uniqueness` theorems hold against
   any signature scheme that satisfies EUF-CMA. The production
   binding (Rust crate `canon-verify-secp256k1`) is a deferred
   follow-up.
2. **The hash function is collision-resistant** (Phase 5 WU 5.1 +
   Workstream D). `verifyProof_sound` and `eip712Wrap_injective`
   hold under `CollisionFree H`. The production keccak256 binding
   (Rust crate `canon-hash-keccak256`) is a deferred follow-up.
3. **The L1 fault-proof verifier (`l1FaultProofVerifier`) reflects
   the on-chain bisection game** (Workstream H). The L1 contract
   under `solidity/` enforces this operationally; the Lean-side
   `opaque` surfaces it as a trust assumption.

### Targeted module builds

For fast incremental feedback, build the layer you're editing:

```bash
lake build LegalKernel.Kernel                  # TCB core
lake build LegalKernel.RBMapLemmas             # §8.3 fold lemmas
lake build LegalKernel.Conservation            # economic-invariants framework
lake build LegalKernel.Laws.Transfer           # one law (hand-written + Lex)
lake build LegalKernel.Authority.SignedAction  # replay_impossible
lake build LegalKernel.Encoding.State          # canonical state encoder
lake build LegalKernel.Runtime.Loop            # Phase-5 runtime
lake build LegalKernel.Disputes.Verdict        # Phase-6 Stage-3 enforcement
lake build LegalKernel.Bridge.WithdrawalRoot   # Workstream-D SMT verifier
lake build LegalKernel.FaultProof.Game         # Workstream-H bisection game
lake build Lex.DSL.Law                         # `lexlaw` macro
lake build Lex.DSL.Deployment                  # `deployment` macro
lake build Deployments.Examples.UsdClearing    # LX-M3 worked example
```

## Documentation map

Each document has a single, sharp scope. When facts disagree across
docs, the precedence is **`GENESIS_PLAN.md` > workstream plans
(Ethereum / Lex / LP / Fault-proof) > module docstrings >
`CLAUDE.md` > `README.md` > everything else.** Any PR that changes
behaviour, theorems, or formalisation status must update the
canonical doc in the same PR (see CLAUDE.md "Documentation rules").

## Reading order for new contributors

1. **Skim** [`docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md`](docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md) §1 – §4
   for the formal model.
2. **Read** `LegalKernel/Kernel.lean` end-to-end — it is the §4.12
   listing in literal form, ~200 lines. Every kernel theorem in
   [Headline theorems](#headline-theorems) lives here.
3. **Pick a law** under `LegalKernel/Laws/` and read its
   precondition, `apply_impl`, and `IsConservative` / `IsMonotonic`
   instance to see how the typeclass firewalls compose. Then read
   its co-located `lexlaw` declaration to see the high-level surface.
4. **Pick a Bridge module** under `LegalKernel/Bridge/` to see how
   non-kernel infrastructure consumes the same proof discipline.
5. **Read** `LegalKernel/FaultProof/Game.lean` for the bisection
   game and its convergence theorem, then
   `LegalKernel/FaultProof/Settlement.lean` for the honest-challenger
   guarantee.
6. **Run** `lake test`; the test files under `LegalKernel/Test/`
   double as worked examples for every theorem.
7. **Read** `Deployments/Examples/UsdClearing.lean` and
   [`docs/lex_amendment_walkthrough.md`](docs/lex_amendment_walkthrough.md)
   for an end-to-end view of an actual deployment under the Lex
   surface plus the governance workflow.
8. **Read** [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) before making any change —
   it owns the engineering conventions, naming rules, and the
   two-reviewer gate for kernel-touching work.

## Headline theorems

A curated subset of the type-level guarantees the build enforces.
The full per-theorem table lives in
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) ("Type-level design properties"). `#print
axioms` on each returns only the three Lean built-ins.

## Contributing

Read [`docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md`](docs/GENESIS_PLAN.md) end-to-end first.
Every change beyond the trivial must reference a work unit
(`WU x.y`) and follow the runbooks in §13.6 – §13.9. Kernel-touching
work units require **two reviewers**; deployment-infrastructure work
units (laws, authority, conservation, bridge, dispute pipeline,
local policies, fault-proof, Lex tooling) require one. See
[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the engineering conventions any human
or AI contributor must follow.

### Reporting issues

Canon is research-stage software. If you discover a logic bug in
the kernel module (e.g. a counterexample to `impl_noop_if_not_pre`,
or a state advance that bypasses the `if` in `step_impl`), open an
issue with the `kernel-soundness` label. Such reports gate any
in-flight PR; the two-reviewer rule applies to the fix.

For non-kernel issues (laws, tooling, documentation), the standard
issue tracker workflow applies.
