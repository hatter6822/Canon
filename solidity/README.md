# Canon Solidity contracts

Workstream E of the Canon ↔ Ethereum integration plan.  This directory
hosts the L1 mirror of Canon's kernel: five immutable contracts
that anchor deposits, state-root submissions, withdrawals, the
dispute pipeline, sequencer staking, and the attested-handoff
migration mechanism.

The full design rationale lives in
[`docs/ethereum_integration_plan.md`](../docs/ethereum_integration_plan.md)
§9 (workstream E) and §20 (immutability amendment).  Read those
sections first; this README is the day-to-day developer guide.

## Build & test

```bash
# Install Foundry (one-time):
curl -sSfL https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/download/v1.7.0/foundry_v1.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  -o /tmp/foundry.tar.gz
tar xzf /tmp/foundry.tar.gz -C /usr/local/foundry/bin
export PATH="/usr/local/foundry/bin:$PATH"

# Install solc 0.8.20 (one-time):
curl -sSfL https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.20/solc-static-linux \
  -o /usr/local/bin/solc
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/solc

# Vendor OpenZeppelin v5.0.2 + forge-std v1.9.4 (run from this dir):
./scripts/vendor-deps.sh

# Build + test (run from this dir):
forge build
forge test
```

`foundry.toml` pins:

* `solc_version = "0.8.20"` (with `evm_version = "shanghai"`).
* `via_ir = true` — required because `CanonBridge.withdrawWithProof`
  and a few other functions are stack-too-deep without it.
* `optimizer_runs = 200`.

## Immutability discipline

Per §4.8 / §20 of the integration plan, every contract here is
deployed immutably:

* **No proxy.**  Each contract goes straight to its final address
  (mainnet via `CREATE2` with deterministic salts; tests via
  `CREATE3` to break the bridge ↔ verifier ↔ stake reference cycle).
* **No `initialize`.**  Constructors set every field; nothing is
  later mutable.
* **No admin role.**  Each cross-contract authority is encoded as
  `address public immutable`.
* **No `pause()` function.**  Whole-system halts use the four
  automatic circuit breakers in `CanonBridge.sol` (§9.1.4):
  `AttestationStale`, `DisputeCooldown`, `TvlCapReached`,
  `MigrationActivated`.  Each fires on a deterministic public-state
  predicate; no privileged caller is involved.
* **Recovery via the dispute pipeline, not via code.**  Bad state
  transitions are reverted by upheld disputes; bad code is replaced
  by deploying a new immutable contract and using `CanonMigration`
  to attest the handoff.

The forge test suite includes a `test_no_admin_surface` assertion
on every contract that confirms the canonical admin selectors
(`pause()`, `unpause()`, `transferOwnership(...)`, `grantRole(...)`,
`upgradeTo(...)`) are not callable.

## CREATE3 deployment

The bridge / verifier / stake cycle is broken at deployment time
using `CREATE3` (see `src/lib/CREATE3.sol`), which derives each
contract's address from `(deployer, salt)` alone — independent of
init-code.  This lets us bake the predicted addresses into each
contract's `immutable` constructor arguments before deploying.

The standard CREATE3 proxy (the `0x67363d3d37363d34f03d5260086018f3`
init-code) does not propagate inner constructor reverts: a failed
inner CREATE returns 0 from the proxy, and our `deploy` helper
detects that with a post-deploy `code.length == 0` check.  This is
the documented behaviour of every standard CREATE3 implementation
(Solady, Solmate).  Production deployment scripts that need
bubbled revert reasons must use a bespoke proxy; the Canon
`CanonMigration` test fixtures use direct `new ...(...)`
deployment so constructor revert reasons propagate verbatim.

## Cross-stack equivalence

Per workstream F.1 of the integration plan, the Solidity contracts
must produce byte-identical results to the Lean reference
implementation.  Specifically:

* `CBEDecode` decodes byte-for-byte the same way as
  `LegalKernel.Encoding.cborHeadDecode`.
* `SmtVerifier.verifyProof` accepts exactly the same proofs as
  `LegalKernel.Bridge.WithdrawalRoot.verifyProof`.
* `CanonEip712`'s digest matches `LegalKernel.Bridge.Eip712.digest`.
* `CanonBridge`'s `receiptHash` derivation matches
  `LegalKernel.Laws.Deposit.depositId`.

The F.1 cross-stack fixture suite (deferred to workstream F's
landing) generates Lean-side inputs and asserts the Solidity-side
verdicts match byte-for-byte across 100+ randomised cases per
fixture.

## Key contracts

### `CanonBridge.sol` (E.1)

The L1 escrow for deposits and withdrawals.  Five sub-WUs:

| WU    | Function                                             |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| E.1.1 | `depositETH()` / `depositERC20(...)` — deposit entry |
| E.1.2 | `submitStateRoot(...)` — attestor-signed state root  |
| E.1.3 | `withdrawWithProof(...)` — proof-gated redemption    |
| E.1.4 | `circuitOpen` modifier — automatic state-driven halt |
| E.1.5 | `revertToPriorRoot(...)` — dispute-triggered rollback |

### `CanonDisputeVerifier.sol` (E.2)

The L1 dispute pipeline.  Three claim variants ship in MVP
(mirroring the Lean `Disputes.Evidence` machinery):

| WU    | Variant                                                      |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| E.2.1 | `fileDispute(...)` + CBE-decode helper library               |
| E.2.2 | `checkSignatureInvalid(...)` — re-runs ECDSA recovery        |
| E.2.3 | `checkNonceMismatch(...)` — replays log prefix nonce-only    |
| E.2.4 | `checkDoubleApply(...)` — `(signer, nonce)` collision check  |
| E.2.5 | `finalizeUpheld(...)` — quorum + slash + rollback            |

`preconditionFalse` and `oracleMisreported` are deferred to v2;
adding them requires a new dispute-verifier deployment + migration.

### `CanonIdentityRegistry.sol` (E.3)

Mirror of the Lean `KeyRegistry` (Authority/Identity.lean).  Two
register entry points (`registerECDSA` for EOAs;
`registerEIP1271` for contract signers) with front-running
protection (the EOA path verifies that
`keccak256(pubkey)[12:] == msg.sender`) and an EIP-1271 probe
(the contract path calls `isValidSignature(bytes32(0), "")`
and accepts only if the contract returns the canonical magic
or a proper "invalid" response).

### `CanonSequencerStake.sol` (E.4)

The sequencer's ETH stake escrow.  Slashed by the dispute
verifier on `.upheld` finalisation: `slashRatioBps * stake / 10_000`
goes to the challenger; the residual is sent to the immutable
burn address.  Withdrawal lock-up is enforced via the bridge's
`hasOpenDisputeOlderThan` getter.

### `CanonMigration.sol` (E.5)

The one-shot, attested handoff between a predecessor and a
successor `CanonBridge`.  Replaces the upgradeable-proxy mechanism
that other rollup designs use for code-level recovery.  Key
properties:

* `MIN_GRACE_WINDOW_BLOCKS = 216_000` (≈ 30 days @ 12s blocks) —
  a Solidity `constant` baked into the bytecode; cannot be
  weakened by any constructor argument.
* Constructor verifies the predecessor's attestor's ECDSA
  signature over the canonical EIP-712 wrap of the migration
  record.
* Bidirectional consent: the constructor asserts
  `successor.migration() == address(this)`.
* `activated` is one-way; once `true`, never reverts.
* Anyone can call `activate()` after the grace window; no role
  gating.

## Production deployment notes

* Use `CREATE3` for all four cyclic contracts (bridge, verifier,
  stake) so the cross-references resolve to predictable addresses.
* The bridge's `migration` immutable should be set to a
  *predicted* `CanonMigration` `CREATE3` address at the time of
  the predecessor's deployment.  At the initial deployment the
  predicted address can be `address(0)` (no migration planned);
  future deployments override.
* Run the full forge test suite (`forge test`) on the deployment
  artefacts as a smoke check before proposing on-chain.
* The "no admin surface" assertion in F.3 (testnet acceptance)
  doubles as a safety check that no upgradeable-proxy bytecode
  has accidentally crept in.
